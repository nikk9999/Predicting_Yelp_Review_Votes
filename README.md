# Predicting_Yelp_Review_Votes
Prediction of social endorsement of Yelp reviews and analysis across business types

Using 'Useful', 'Cool' and 'Funny' votes of each review, a model to predict social endorsement is created. 
A classification model to predict if a review receives a vote or not is created.
Also, important features in gaining votes across business types are analyzed.
